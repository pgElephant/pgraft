### Coding Standards

#### PostgreSQL C Code

- Follow PostgreSQL C coding conventions
- Use `/* */` style comments, not `//`
- Declare variables at the start of functions
- Use the Allman brace style (opening brace on its own line)
- Keep functions under 100 lines when possible

#### Go Code

- Follow standard Go conventions
- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Write comprehensive comments for exported functions
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

#### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
- Start with a verb in present tense (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Provide additional context in the body if needed
